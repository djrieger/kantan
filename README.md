kantan
======

Currently two groups of friends of mine manage group expenses (such as Alice bought beef for our barbecueue for Bob and Claire for 10 €) using an application I developed, called "Schuldenliste". To overcome the many limitations of this Google Spreadsheets/Google Apps Script based solution, I decided to create kantan as a new and more powerful expense management system based on Groovy and Grails.

With the first milestone ("Make application useable") I want to bring kantan to the same level as the existing application which includes features such as:
* Add new expenses and notify debitors via e-mail
* View all expenses
* Settle debts, i.e. calculating who has to pay whom how much
* E-mail notification on settlement ("You owe Lucas 5.34 €") including bank details if users provided them ("You owe Lucas 5.34 €. Lucas wants you to transfer the money instead of paying him in cash. Bank account number: ...) 

kantan is still at a very early stage of development and not usable yet. If you have any suggestions or want to help improve it, feel free to contribute.
